# What is ad-hoc mode?

Ad-hoc mode is one of the two modes of operation of the standard IEEE 802.11, more commonly known as wireless LAN or WiFi. The other is infrastructure mode.

The most widely known mode of operation is infrastructure mode: there is one  or more access points (AP) to which other wireless-enabled devices, called stations (STA), connect to. Usually APs are wireless routers, and STAs are devices such as smartphones and laptops. To send data from one STA to another, it first must go through the AP.

In contrast to infrastructure mode, ad-hoc mode does not require an AP. Any two STAs in range of each other can exchange data directly. This is particularly useful in scenarios when infrastructure is not available. If you want to read more on application areas of ad-hoc mode, please [follow this link](usage-scenarios.md).
