# Real Ad-hoc Mode Support

This repository contains all the infos/thoughts/problems/etc we have been gathering on the issue of ad-hoc mode support. Feel free to contribute to it.

The goal is to organize a campaign to push manufacturers, developers and related entities to support the full IEEE 802.11 standard - which includes ad-hoc mode. To begin with, we will try to document thoroughly the current problems hindering ad-hoc mode adoption, as well as why we need it.

Here is an overview of the documents we are compiling at the moment:
* [explanation of IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc mode](what-is-adhoc.md)
* [why ad_hoc mode adoption is not widespread](problem.md)
* [why is ad-hoc mode important? - i.e. what can it be used for](usage-scenarios.md)

## Meet us at 32C3

We are just starting this campaign at 32C3 so join us at our assembly. We are seated between Freifunk and Chaos Darmstadt in the large assembly hall, right at its main door.

## Meet us on IRC

We're in the channel **#rams** both on freenode and hackint.
