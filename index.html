<title>Campaign for Real Ad-Hoc Mode Support</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Greetings visitor! We are setting up this campaign at 32C3 so meet us at our assembly. We are seated between Freifunk and Chaos Darmstadt in the large assembly hall, right at its main door. We're also online: #rams on hackint and freenode.</p>
<p>Coming soon: what is ad-hoc mode and why you should care; what could it be used for; why don't we have it; and how we intend to change this scenario.</p>
