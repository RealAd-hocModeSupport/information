# What can Ad-hoc Mode be used for?

There are times when infrastructure (power, communication networks) are not available, for example after a disaster, or when it is being tampered with by an adversary. Additionally, in certain situations, one may not want to use infrastructure for privacy reasons.

Several projects use ad-hoc mode successfully:
* [Serval Project](http://www.servalproject.org/) - allows mobile devices to connect to each other and form a wireless network where users can send messages or call each other. It was essential during disaster relief operations during the Queensland floods in Australia, for example.
* [Freifunk](http://www.freifunk.net/) - wireless routers connect to each other over ad-hoc mode, building a community-driven wireless mesh spanning entire cities. The network is open for everyone to use and allows, among other things, to extend Internet access to areas with limited connectivity.
* [VillageTelco](http://villagetelco.org/) - a project to easily deploy communication networks in areas lacking infrastructure.

Other projects that use infrastructureless communication between end-user devices usually resort to Bluetooth or WiFi Direct. However, the implementation of these technologies is often faulty and frustrating to use, apart from being limited in functionality. More details on these issues can be found [here](problem.md).

There are attempts to build smartphone applications ([MoP2MoP](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwib1puAwvzJAhVCeg8KHYaADDYQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de%2Ffileadmin%2Fuser_upload%2FGroup_TRUST%2FPubsPDF%2Ffc14-paper99-final_draft_v3.pdf&usg=AFQjCNG3L1DoOsssPrAWQGFobZAaTksucQ), [Timberdoodle](https://github.com/timberdoodle/TimberdoodleApp), [Briar Project](https://briarproject.org/)) for anonymous communication that would benefit greatly from ad-hoc mode, as the limitations of Bluetooth and WiFi Direct significantly decrease performance and usability.
